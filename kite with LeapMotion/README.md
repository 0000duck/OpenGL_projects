# Description: 
A kite simulation, which uses mass-spring method to simulate the string of the kite, 
and a use of aeronautical dynamics data to upde the kite itself. You can use "W"，“S”,“A”,“D” to
control the movement of the kite, also, we implement the interactive function which you can use
the Leap Motion to do the same thing.
